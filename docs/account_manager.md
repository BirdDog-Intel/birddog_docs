### Overview
The **Account Manager** page is where you can **prune, update, and organize** your account lists. It mirrors the accounts shown on the **Home Page**, but gives you more control for uploading, archiving, filtering, and creating lists.

---

### Core Concepts

#### Active vs Archive
- **Active Accounts**:  
  - Continuously monitored every day for new signals.  
  - Stay in your daily workflow.  
- **Archived Accounts**:  
  - Moved out of daily monitoring.  
  - Free up space so you can add new accounts.  
  - Useful when you’ve already worked an account (sold, lost, disqualified, etc.).

Archiving is essential for **staying under your account limits** while keeping your list fresh.

### Adding Accounts
1. **Upload Company URLs**  
   - Paste one or more company URLs directly into the input box.  
   - BirdDog scrapes the data and adds them to your chosen list.  

2. **Assign to Lists**  
   - Choose the list where the new account should live (e.g., *Master List*, *Enterprise Sales Team*).  
   - Accounts can exist in multiple lists if needed.  

3. **Scoring**  
   - Newly added accounts start at 0 points.  
   - Within ~20 minutes, BirdDog will scrape and assign them a score.

---

### Managing Limits & Credits
- Every user has an **account limit** (e.g., 100 accounts).  
- Each month your **credits reset**, allowing you to replace accounts.  
- To add new accounts when you’re at the limit, you must:  
  - **Archive** old accounts (frees up credits).  
  - Then use credits to add new ones.  

**Example:**  
- Limit: 100 accounts  
- Currently uploaded: 100  
- At reset → you get 100 credits, but must archive some active accounts to use them.

---

### Bulk Actions
- **Archive in bulk** – remove multiple accounts at once.  
- **Delete in bulk** – permanently remove accounts.  
- **Export in bulk** – download account data for offline use.  

Selections can be made using checkboxes beside accounts.

---

### Filters
Use filters (similar to the Home Page) to quickly find accounts.  
- By account name  
- By list  
- By status (active, archived)  
- By score  
- Other filters (signals, location, etc.)

---

### Lists
- Accounts are organized into **lists**, which act as buckets.  
- Examples: *Healthcare*, *Enterprise*, *Technology*.  
- Each list can run **different signals**.  

**List Management Options:**  
- Create new lists (e.g., “Demo List”)  
- Rename existing lists  
- Delete lists you no longer need  

---

### Summary
The **Account Manager** page gives you full control over which accounts BirdDog is monitoring.  

- **Add new accounts** by uploading URLs.  
- **Archive old accounts** to free up space for new ones.  
- **Use lists** to segment accounts by industry, region, or sales strategy.  
- **Manage limits** through monthly credits and bulk actions.  

Think of Account Manager as your **control center for prospect lists** — making sure you’re always focusing on the most valuable accounts.
