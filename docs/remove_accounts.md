### Overview
Maintaining a clean and relevant book of business is critical for accurate signal tracking. BirdDog provides three primary ways to manage your account list: **Deleting**, **Archiving**, and **Activating**. Whether you are a rep cleaning up your personal view or an admin managing the entire organization's capacity, these tools ensure you are only monitoring the accounts that matter.

### User Actions: My Accounts Page (0:00 – 0:31)
Individual users can manage their assigned accounts directly from the main dashboard.

1.  **Select Accounts:** Use the checkboxes next to company names to select individual accounts, or run a **Filter** (e.g., Score < 10) to select a specific group.
2.  **Choose Action:** A bulk-action menu will appear with the following options:
    * **Delete:** Permanently removes the account and its historical signals from your view.
    * **Archive:** Removes the account from your active monitoring but keeps it in the system. This is the best way to **free up capacity** without losing the account data entirely.
    * **Activate:** If you are viewing your "Archived" list, use this to bring a company back into active monitoring.

### Admin Actions: System Setup (0:32 – 1:01)
Admins have a high-level view of all accounts across every user's list. This is useful for clearing out legacy data or re-balancing account loads across the team.

1.  Navigate to **System Setup** in the bottom-left corner.
2.  Click on **Manage Accounts**.
3.  **Granular Management:** This view lists every account currently in the platform. You can:
    * Filter by **Rep/Owner** to clean up a specific team member's list.
    * Filter by **Last Activity** or **Point Score** to identify dead leads.
    * Bulk-delete or archive accounts at the organizational level.

### Archive vs. Delete: Quick Reference

| Action | Result | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Archive** | Stops active tracking; frees up a license "seat." | Accounts that *might* be relevant later or accounts you want to keep in your CRM history. |
| **Delete** | Wipes the account and all associated signal data. | Competitors, duplicates, or accounts that no longer fit your ICP. |

### Pro-Tip: Capacity Management
If you are trying to add a new list of URLs and get a "Capacity Reached" error, go to your **Manage Accounts** page and filter for accounts with a **Score of 0**. Archiving these accounts is the fastest way to make room for new high-intent prospects.
