### Overview
**Plays** are pre-saved, dynamic filters that allow you to segment your book of business based on specific buying personas or sales strategies. Instead of manually filtering your accounts every day, Plays act as automated "buckets" that instantly surface accounts matching your specific criteria—such as "Expansion Opportunities" or "New Sales Leadership."

### How to Create a New Play (0:29 – 3:15)

#### 1. Name & Description
Click **Create new play** and define your objective. 
* *Example:* "Startups Formalizing" 
* *Description:* "Hiring first sales rep or recently funded."

#### 2. CRM Stage Filters
You can choose to limit your play to specific stages in your pipeline (Closed-Lost, Discovery, etc.). 
* **Net New:** Leave this blank to focus on accounts not yet in your active sales cycle.
* **Expansion:** Filter for "Closed-Won" deals to identify existing customers with new growth signals.

#### 3. Signal Logic: OR vs. AND vs. NOT
This is the engine of your Play. You can layer signals using three types of logic:
* **OR Signals (Broadest):** Surfaces accounts that have *at least one* of the selected signals. (e.g., "Funding Round" OR "New Sales Leader").
* **AND Signals (Narrowest):** Surfaces only accounts that have *all* selected signals.
* **NOT Signals (Exclusion):** Prevents accounts with certain triggers from appearing in the Play.

#### 4. Firmographic Guardrails
Refine your play with specific company data:
* **Employee Count:** Limit the size of companies (e.g., 10–100 employees).
* **Geography:** Include or exclude specific countries or U.S. states.
* **Industry:** Target specific sectors like "Software" or "Financial Services."

### Accessing Your Results (3:16 – 3:30)
Once created, your Play appears as a card on the main dashboard. 
* **Real-time Updates:** As BirdDog finds new signals across your account list, those companies will automatically populate the relevant Plays.
* **Deep Dive:** Click into any Play card to view the specific accounts and their corresponding signals.

---

### Popular Play Examples
* **The "Re-Engagement" Play:** CRM Stage = *Closed-Lost* + Signal = *New Sales Leader* (OR) *Funding Round*.
* **The "First Sales Hire" Play:** Signal = *First Enterprise Salesperson* (AND) *Employee Count < 50*.
* **The "Market Expansion" Play:** Geography = *Western Europe* + Signal = *Hiring Multiple Salespeople*.

### Pro-Tip: The Logic Balance
Most successful teams use **OR logic** for their primary Plays to ensure a healthy volume of prospects. Use **AND logic** only for highly specialized "Sniper" campaigns where multiple conditions must be met before outreach.
