### Overview
**Signal Context** is a powerful feature in BirdDog that allows you to add **additional filters, qualifiers, and descriptive context** to any signal.  

It helps BirdDog understand exactly what you’re looking for — refining results, improving precision, and ensuring that your generated insights and outreach are aligned with your intent.

### Why It Matters
- Fine-tunes how BirdDog interprets each signal.  
- Adds nuance and specificity to your signal definitions.  
- Reduces irrelevant or overly broad signal matches.  
- Enables deeper personalization in research and email generation.  

### Adding Context to a Signal (0:00 – 1:09)
1. Go to the **Signals** page in BirdDog.  
2. Find the signal you want to refine.  
3. Click the **context icon** next to that signal.  
4. In the new **BirdDog Context** box, you can type in additional detail about what you want BirdDog to consider.  

Examples:  
- “Only include accounts using research for outbound personalization.”  
- “Exclude those using research for internal analysis.”  
- “Only show results for companies based in the United States.”  

You can add filters, qualifiers, or even descriptive phrases — anything that helps BirdDog better understand the intent behind your signal.

### Updating and Applying Context (1:09 – 1:33)
After entering your context:
1. Click **Update** to save your changes.  
2. BirdDog will immediately begin using your new context to refine how it processes that signal.  
3. The updated signal will now generate **narrower, more accurate** results that better reflect your criteria.  

### Best Practices
- Use natural language — describe what you *mean*, not just keywords.  
- Add qualifiers like location, intent, or use case to sharpen precision.  
- Adjust or expand context over time as you see how signals perform.  
- Use Signal Context to ensure AI-generated outputs match your desired scope.  

### Summary
**Signal Context** gives you granular control over how BirdDog interprets and executes signals.  

- Add detailed qualifiers or filters directly within any signal.  
- Refine the results to better match your goals and ICP.  
- Combine with **Email Templates** and **Signal Automations** for deeper personalization.  

The result: smarter, context-aware signals that deliver the **right insights for the right accounts**, every time.
