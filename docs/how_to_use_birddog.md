### Overview
**Farsight** is BirdDog’s **account recommendation engine**. It continuously improves your account list by replacing low-scoring accounts with stronger, high-potential ones.  

It can work in three main modes:  
1. **My List Mode** – improve from a specific list you upload  
2. **Entire Internet Mode** – let BirdDog discover net-new accounts that fit your ICP  
3. **Auto-Add** – automatically insert new accounts that meet thresholds  

---

### Why Farsight Matters
- Not all accounts in your CRM or lists are high quality. Many may score low (e.g., 3–5 points).  
- Farsight automatically surfaces better accounts so reps don’t waste time.  
- It can be run manually (reviewing recommendations) or automatically (auto-add).  

---

### My List Mode (1:09 – 3:45)
Use this mode when you already have a list of companies you want BirdDog to analyze.  

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Setup → Lists**.  
2. Upload a CSV of **company URLs** (from Apollo, ZoomInfo, CRM, or manual list).  
   - Supports up to **10,000 companies**.  
   - BirdDog scrapes, cleans, and scores them.  
3. Set criteria for replacement:  
   - Example: Replace accounts scoring under **10 points** with accounts above **30 points**.  
4. Save & run. Farsight will continuously review and upgrade your list.  

**Best for:**  
- Cleaning and enriching large CRM exports.  
- Improving quality of existing account lists.  

---

### Entire Internet Mode (4:09 – 5:35)
Use this mode when you want BirdDog to **find net-new accounts** that look like your ICP.  

**Steps:**
1. Choose **Entire Internet** mode in setup.  
2. Define parameters:  
   - **Employee range** (e.g., 50–5000)  
   - **Geographies** (e.g., United States, United Kingdom)  
   - **Sectors/industries** (e.g., Technology, SaaS)  
3. Save & run. BirdDog will:  
   - Compare your current account list.  
   - Find lookalike companies in similar industries, geographies, and sizes.  
   - Recommend new accounts nightly.  

**Best for:**  
- Expanding into new territories.  
- Building a strong ICP-aligned pipeline from scratch.  

---

### Auto-Add Recommended Accounts (2:24 – 3:17, 5:35 – 6:19)
Auto-Add lets BirdDog insert accounts into your list automatically when they meet your thresholds.  

**Setup Example:**
- Add accounts if:  
  - Score > **30 points**  
  - Match certain **signals** (e.g., hiring salespeople)  
  - Keep list below **X max accounts** (e.g., 400)  

**Workflow Options:**  
- **Auto-Add ON:** Accounts are added without manual review.  
- **Auto-Add OFF:** You review recommendations in Farsight and press:  
  - **Y** → Accept account  
  - **N** → Dismiss account  

**Best for:**  
- Teams that want fresh, high-quality accounts without constant list management.  
- Ensuring lists stay at full capacity while replacing poor performers.  

---

### Managing & Reviewing Accounts
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**  
  - `Y` → Accept recommended account  
  - `N` → Dismiss account  
- **List Cleaning:** Automatically remove underperformers (<10 points).  
- **Nightly Refresh:** Farsight updates recommendations every night.  

---

### Summary
Farsight ensures your sales team always works the **best possible account list**.  

- **My List Mode:** Upload and clean your own accounts.  
- **Entire Internet Mode:** Discover net-new accounts that match your ICP.  
- **Auto-Add:** Automate the process to keep lists full of strong accounts.  
- **Manual Review:** Use Y/N shortcuts to approve or dismiss accounts.  

The result: higher quality accounts, stronger signals, and more efficient pipeline building.

### Overview
The **Signals Page** is the *heart of BirdDog*. This is where you create and manage the signals that BirdDog searches for across its data sources. A well-crafted set of signals means your reps receive timely, relevant buying intent data directly from news, filings, jobs, and other sources.

---

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 0:00 – Introduction
- The Signals page = **where you define what BirdDog looks for**.
- Signals are essentially **custom search queries** for accounts.

#### 0:25 – Creating a New Signal
1. Use the **input box** at the top to define a new signal.  
   Example:  
2. Always start with the account variable (`{account}`) in brackets.
3. Pick the **list** you want the signal applied to (e.g., *Enterprise Sales Team*).
4. Give the signal a **title** for tracking.
5. BirdDog will immediately start scanning sources for matching activity.

#### 1:29 – Best Practices for Writing Signals
- Start signals with **“Does”** or **“Is”** (e.g., *Does the account mention hiring multiple roles?*).  
- Think about **behavioral cues**:
- Hiring multiple sales roles
- Sales team required to do account research
- Sales leader engaging with “intent data”  
- Add **disqualifying questions** to filter out noise (e.g., “Exclude recruiting agencies”).

**Sources BirdDog scans:**  
- Press releases  
- News articles  
- Company websites  
- Job postings  
- Earnings calls & reports  

#### 2:54 – Managing Signals
- **Results count:** Shows how many matches BirdDog has found.  
- **Mute option:** Turn off notifications (Slack, Teams, email) for specific signals.  
- **Priority setting:** Mark signals as *High* to:
- Influence account rankings  
- Improve recommendations from **Farsight**  

#### 3:36 – Connecting Templates
- Link a signal directly to an **email template** (created in *Settings*).  
- This makes it easier to act on signals quickly.

#### 3:49 – Editing Signals
- Correct typos, retest queries, or rename titles at any time.  
- Add **BirdDog Context**:  
- This is like a “prompt” to refine how BirdDog interprets signals.  
- Example: “Only show results in US or Europe hiring junior roles.”

#### 4:34 – Teaching BirdDog
- Continuously refine signals as you see results.  
- Add nuances like geography, role level, or business line.  
- Over time, the system learns what matters most to you.

#### 4:42 – Deleting Signals
- If a signal is no longer useful, simply remove it from your list.

---

### Recommendations
- Create **10–15 strong signals** per team to cover different scenarios.  
- Mix **positive buying cues** (new hires, product launches) with **negative/disqualifying ones** (recruiters, unrelated industries).  
- Use **priority levels** to focus reps on the highest-value accounts.  
- Iterate often — BirdDog gets smarter the more you refine signals.

---

### Summary
The Signals Page is where you **train BirdDog to hunt**.  
By writing clear, creative, and precise signals, you ensure your sales team only sees the **most relevant buying triggers**. This saves time, improves targeting, and boosts pipeline quality.

### Overview
The **Account Manager** page is where you can **prune, update, and organize** your account lists. It mirrors the accounts shown on the **Home Page**, but gives you more control for uploading, archiving, filtering, and creating lists.

---

### Core Concepts

#### Active vs Archive
- **Active Accounts**:  
  - Continuously monitored every day for new signals.  
  - Stay in your daily workflow.  
- **Archived Accounts**:  
  - Moved out of daily monitoring.  
  - Free up space so you can add new accounts.  
  - Useful when you’ve already worked an account (sold, lost, disqualified, etc.).

Archiving is essential for **staying under your account limits** while keeping your list fresh.

---

### Adding Accounts
1. **Upload Company URLs**  
   - Paste one or more company URLs directly into the input box.  
   - BirdDog scrapes the data and adds them to your chosen list.  

2. **Assign to Lists**  
   - Choose the list where the new account should live (e.g., *Master List*, *Enterprise Sales Team*).  
   - Accounts can exist in multiple lists if needed.  

3. **Scoring**  
   - Newly added accounts start at 0 points.  
   - Within ~20 minutes, BirdDog will scrape and assign them a score.

---

### Managing Limits & Credits
- Every user has an **account limit** (e.g., 100 accounts).  
- Each month your **credits reset**, allowing you to replace accounts.  
- To add new accounts when you’re at the limit, you must:  
  - **Archive** old accounts (frees up credits).  
  - Then use credits to add new ones.  

**Example:**  
- Limit: 100 accounts  
- Currently uploaded: 100  
- At reset → you get 100 credits, but must archive some active accounts to use them.

---

### Bulk Actions
- **Archive in bulk** – remove multiple accounts at once.  
- **Delete in bulk** – permanently remove accounts.  
- **Export in bulk** – download account data for offline use.  

Selections can be made using checkboxes beside accounts.

---

### Filters
Use filters (similar to the Home Page) to quickly find accounts.  
- By account name  
- By list  
- By status (active, archived)  
- By score  
- Other filters (signals, location, etc.)

---

### Lists
- Accounts are organized into **lists**, which act as buckets.  
- Examples: *Healthcare*, *Enterprise*, *Technology*.  
- Each list can run **different signals**.  

**List Management Options:**  
- Create new lists (e.g., “Demo List”)  
- Rename existing lists  
- Delete lists you no longer need  

---

### Summary
The **Account Manager** page gives you full control over which accounts BirdDog is monitoring.  

- **Add new accounts** by uploading URLs.  
- **Archive old accounts** to free up space for new ones.  
- **Use lists** to segment accounts by industry, region, or sales strategy.  
- **Manage limits** through monthly credits and bulk actions.  

Think of Account Manager as your **control center for prospect lists** — making sure you’re always focusing on the most valuable accounts.
