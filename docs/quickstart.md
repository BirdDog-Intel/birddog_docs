# Getting Setup

Getting your BirdDog account set up correctly is the fastest way to turn cold data into warm leads. By following these steps, you move from manually hunting for information to having an AI-driven system that alerts you the moment a company is ready for a conversation.

### 1. Add Your Current Accounts
The first thing you need to do is tell BirdDog which companies you already care about. This gives the system a starting point to learn what your "ideal customer" looks like.

* **What to do:** Take a list of company website links (URLs) from your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot) or a spreadsheet and put them into BirdDog.
* **Why it matters:** BirdDog needs to "watch" these companies to find patterns in their behavior.

### 2. Choose Your Signals
Signals are "events" that BirdDog looks for on the internet. Think of them as triggers that tell you a company might be ready to buy your product.

* **Common Signals:** A company just got new funding, they are hiring a new Vice President of Sales, or they just opened a new office.
* **What to do:** Go into your settings and mark the most important events as **High**. This tells BirdDog to alert you immediately when these happen.

### 3. Turn on the "Farsight" Finder
Once the system knows your current accounts and what signals you like, it can start hunting for new companies you’ve never heard of. This feature is called **Farsight**.

* **How it works:** Farsight scans the entire internet. If it finds a company that looks exactly like your best customers and is showing "High" signals, it will recommend them to you.
* **Filters:** You can set rules so it only finds companies of a certain size (like 50–200 employees) or in specific locations (like the United States).
* **Action:** [How to get recommendations](account_rec_setup.md)

### 4. Connect to Slack and Your Calendar
To make sure you don't have to keep checking the BirdDog website all day, you should connect it to the tools you use for work.

* **Slack:** BirdDog will send a message to your team's Slack channel the moment it finds a "High" signal.
* **Google Calendar:** BirdDog will look at your upcoming meetings. 24 hours before a call, it will email you a "Cheat Sheet" about that company so you are fully prepared.
* **Action:** [Slack setup](slack.md) | [Google Calendar setup](gcal.md)



### 5. Organize Your "Plays"
As you get more accounts, you’ll want to group them. We call these **Plays**. A Play is just a folder that updates itself automatically based on rules you set.

* **Example Play:** "New Sales Leaders." You can make a folder that only shows companies that have hired a new Sales Director in the last 3 months.
* **Action:** [How to create Plays](create_plays.md)

### Managing Your Team
If you are an administrator, you will need to add your team members so they can see their own accounts and receive their own alerts.

* **Roles:** You can set people as **Normal** (they see their own stuff), **View-Only** (they help another rep), or **Manager** (they see everything).
* **Action:** [Adding Users](adding_user.md)
