### Overview
Managing your team's access is a critical part of maintaining BirdDog's security and organizational health. As an **Admin**, you have the ability to immediately revoke access for any user. However, deleting a user is a permanent action with significant data consequences, so it should be handled with care.

### How to Remove a User (0:00 – 0:19)
The process is designed to be quick and definitive:
1.  Navigate to the **System Setup** page from the bottom-left sidebar.
2.  Locate the user you wish to remove from the active users list.
3.  Click the **Delete** button next to their name.
4.  The user is immediately removed from the platform.

### Critical Considerations (0:20 – 0:41)
Before you delete a user, it is important to understand the downstream effects:

* **Account Removal:** All accounts currently assigned specifically to that user will be removed from your organization's active monitoring list. 
* **Credential Revocation:** The user will immediately lose their login access and can no longer view or interface with BirdDog data.
* **Permanent Action:** Deletion is not a "pause." If you wish to bring a team member back later, you will need to recreate their profile from scratch, re-authenticate their integrations, and re-add their entire account list.

### Pro-Tip: Offboarding Best Practices
If a rep is leaving the company but you want to keep their accounts and signal history, **do not delete them immediately**. 

Instead, use the **Manage Accounts** tool in System Setup to re-assign their accounts to a different team member or a manager first. Once the accounts have been safely moved to a new owner, you can proceed with deleting the user without losing your valuable research and tracking data.
