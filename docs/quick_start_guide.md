# Quick Start Guide

The below steps will make sure your BirdDog Instance has everything you need to send out highly relevant emails in less than an hour

1. **Upload Accounts** *(<5 min)*
2. **Create Signals** *(<15 min)*
3. **Add Email Templates** *(<15 min)*
4. **Create Workflow** *(<5 min)*
5. **Take Your First Actions**  *(<10 min)*

Some more advanced features include Farsight and Custom Signals, but to get started, we recommend taking the above 5 steps.

## Upload Accounts

<i>Estimated Time: <5 min </i>

The first thing you’ll want to do to provision BirdDog is to grab a list of urls for the accounts you’re most interested in tracking. 

To upload them to the platform, you’ll want them as a comma separated list like this:

```py
apple.com, meta.com, lululemon.com
```

You can upload as many as you want at one time.

<u>Instructions</u>

1. Click Accounts on the left nav bar
2. Click “Add Accounts”
3. Paste your list of urls into the enter urls box
4. Select a list using the “Select a list” drop down menu. Unless you already set up a list, you’ll want to select Master
5. Click “Submit”

Now, BirdDog will start looking for information on those accounts!

## Create Signals

<i>Estimated Time: <15 min </i>

You can quickly creates signals with BirdDog on the ‘Signals’ page by leveraging the Signal Library to quickly select some of the most popular questions that users ask. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 64.90384615384616%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/313ebfc6a5ba490dac26d28afd5dc1c5?sid=1e5ccb71-173f-4c86-ac96-998b1e24bd11" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

<u>Instructions</u>

1. Click Signals on the left nav bar
2. Click Add Signal
3. Click Signal Library
4. Click the use button next to the desired Signal
5. Edit the Question to make sure it matches your needs
6. Add a title to the question (this is for you to refer to the question later but does not impact the signal)
7. Click “Apply to All”
8. Repeat Steps 2-7 until you have 8 

## Add Email Templates

<i>Estimated Time: <15 min </i>

*If you exclusively cold call, feel free to skip this step.*

To quickly generate high quality emails within the BirdDog platform, you can provision email templates and attach them to some of the signals we’ve just made.

Some users write templates work with multiple signals, other users make a different template for each signal they’re going to send emails about.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 64.90384615384616%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/68e5954035c0487f876d18be47f8701d?sid=67cfdfae-108a-40b0-bbb0-0c0e72f37a63" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

<u>Instructions</u>

1. Select a Signal that you’d like to have a template for. You don’t need to mark this down anywhere, you just need to know so you can write a good email.
2. Find a real email you’ve sent about that signal. If you don’t have one, you can use this GPT to generate some examples for you. [LINK TO GPT]
3. Click the “Settings” button on the bottom of the left nav bar
4. Scroll down to the Email Templates section and click “Add Templates”
5. Enter a Title for the template - this will be for your reference later
6. Copy and paste the email you’d like to use as a template to the Example Email box. You don’t have to edit anything—it is just an example for BirdDog to use when it goes to write your email later.
7. Copy and paste the same email into the template box. This time, replace any sentences you want BirdDog to rewrite with a brief description of what you want it to write in <<brackets like this>>. BirdDog will use the information about the signal we picked above to replace that text. Some examples:
    1. <<note about recent growth milestone>>
    2. <<note about hiring devops engineers>>
    3. <<congrats on new position>>
8. Click “Submit”
9. Go to the “Signals” menu on the left navbar
10. Navigate to the signal that the email template is for
11. In the ‘Email Template’ column, select the template you just created

Now, when you select an article related to that signal in the platform, BirdDog will use your template to generate a draft!

## Add Workflows

<i>Estimated Time: <5 min </i>

The final step before we start taking action in BirdDog is to set up Workflows.

Workflows are custom to do lists that you set up for your accounts. In a way, they are like human in the loop sequences. 

Setting up a workflow is as simple as deciding which actions you want to take each day that you’re working on an account. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/375f6111fa4049c38847c2253ee31037?sid=e719971b-bf13-408a-8d12-9a5c398ff4ad" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

<u>Instructions</u>

1. Click Workflows on the left nav bar
2. Click ‘Build Your Strategy’
3. Select the number of emails, linkedin connects, and phone calls you want to make on day one of your workflow
4. Click Save
5. Click Add Next Step
6. Repeat Steps 3-4 until your sequence is done
7. Click Go Back in the top right corner 
8. Pick an account on your account list in the workflow page and change the “status” column from “Sideline” to “Working”
9. Repeat step 8 as many times as you like - most users have 5 to 10 accounts in play at any given time

Now you’re ready to hit the ground running with BirdDog.

## Take Your First Action

<i>Estimated Time: <10 min </i>

Now that we have accounts uploaded, signals in place, email templates added, and workflows set up, it’s super easy to put all of the high powered research BirdDog has done for you to work.

When you go to the main dashboard, you’ll see the accounts in your workflows with active todo’s highlighted in blue. 

Then, you can use the data to take action!

Below are examples of how you can send connections, write emails, and cold call using the data in BirdDog. Ultimately, though, it’s about using the method that already works best for you or finding one that works well and sticking to it.

### Sending Connections
