### Overview
To ensure maximum speed and stability in account filtering, BirdDog Plays are currently "static" once created. If you need to refine your logic, add a new signal, or change the employee count range for an existing Play, the most efficient method is to **delete and recreate** the Play.

### The "Edit" Workflow (0:00 – 0:31)
Since there is no direct "Edit" button for an active Play, follow these steps to adjust your strategy:

1.  **Note Your Criteria:** Briefly review your current Play to note which signals or CRM stages you want to keep.
2.  **Delete the Old Play:** Click the three dots (⋮) on the Play card and confirm deletion (this declutters your dashboard for the new version).
3.  **Re-Run Setup:** Click **Create New Play** and follow the standard setup wizard:
    * **CRM Stages:** Adjust which deal stages should be included.
    * **Signal Logic:** Refine your OR/AND/NOT logic.
    * **Firmographics:** Update employee counts, geography, or industry filters.
4.  **Save & Run:** Your new, adjusted Play will immediately begin scanning your accounts.

### Why Recreating is Better Than Editing
* **Clean Data Pull:** Recreating the Play triggers a fresh scan of your account list against the new parameters, ensuring no outdated data is "cached."
* **Logic Verification:** It forces a quick review of your **OR/AND** logic, which is where most filtering errors occur.
* **Dashboard Organization:** It prevents "filter bloat" by ensuring you only have active, optimized Plays on your Assignment Desk.

### Pro-Tip: Iterative Testing
If a Play is returning too many accounts, recreate it using **AND logic** for your signals. If it’s returning too few, recreate it using **OR logic** and broaden your firmographic ranges (e.g., increasing the employee count limit).
