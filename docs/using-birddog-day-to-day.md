# Using BirdDog Day to Day

## Overview
Once youâ€™ve uploaded your accounts and created your signals, your daily interaction with BirdDog becomes simple and focused.

Youâ€™ll primarily use two pages:
- **Home page** â€” to monitor real-time activity on your tracked accounts  
- **Farsight page** â€” to discover high-potential, net-new accounts you may have missed  

No need to repeatedly manage account uploads or signal creationâ€”BirdDog continuously runs in the background, surfacing the most relevant insights as they happen.

> **Note:** You should not use *Account Manager* to see an account's information. All that data (and more) is available on the Home page.

## What You Should Have Set Up First
Before using BirdDog for day-to-day prospecting, make sure you have:
- Uploaded your account list  
- Created 6â€“8 high-quality Signals  
- (Optional) Connected your email or CRM integrations  
- (Optional) Enabled Farsight for your key lists  

Once this is done, the platform starts generating value automatically.

## Filtering Results on the Home Page

The Home page is where you review Signals triggered across your tracked accounts. To focus your view and quickly find the most relevant activity, use the filter panel.

### How to Access Filters
1. Navigate to the **Home** page  
2. Click the filter icon or **Apply Filters** button at the top of the account list  

### Available Filters
The filter panel gives you full control over how results are displayed:

| Filter | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Name** | Search for a specific account by name |
| **Location** | Filter accounts by geographical location |
| **List** | Show only accounts in a specific list |
| **Signals** | Limit results to accounts with specific Signals triggered (e.g., Funding, Executive Hire) |
| **Characteristics** | Filter based on accounts with new info, accounts from Farsight, and other options |
| **Employees** | Set a minimum or maximum employee count range |
| **Sort By** | Sort your results by Account Rank or Signal Recency |

At the bottom of the panel, youâ€™ll also see the number of matching results (e.g., *11 Results*).
