### Overview
BirdDog is built for collaboration. Whether you are onboarding a new AE, an SDR, or a Sales Manager, the **System Setup** page allows you to control exactly what each user can see and do within the platform. Adding a user triggers an automated welcome email with their credentials and onboarding documentation.

### User Roles & Permissions (0:22 – 2:00)

BirdDog offers three distinct user types to match your team’s structure:

| Role | Access Level | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | Can add and manage their own account lists. Can optionally be granted Admin rights to see System Setup/Assignment Desk. | **AEs & Full-Cycle Reps.** Most users (99%) should be set up with this role. |
| **View-Only** | Cannot add or edit accounts. They must be assigned to "follow" a specific Normal user's list. | **SDRs/BDRs** who are paired with an AE and need to research their partner's book of business. |
| **Manager** | Full visibility across the entire team’s accounts and progress. Automatic Admin access to the Assignment Desk and System Setup. | **Sales Leaders & RevOps** who need a "God View" but aren't actively working individual deals. |

### How to Add a User (0:12 – 2:15)

1.  Navigate to **System Setup** in the bottom-left sidebar.
2.  Click the **Add a User** button.
3.  **Choose the Role:** Select from Normal, View-Only, or Manager.
4.  **Enter Email:** Input the user's professional email address.
5.  **Configure Visibility:** * If adding a **Normal** user, choose if they should be able to view other teammates' accounts.
    * If adding a **View-Only** user, select the specific teammate they are supporting.
6.  **Admin Toggle:** For Normal users, choose "Yes" or "No" for Admin access. Admins can access:
    * **Assignment Desk** (Farsight recommendations)
    * **Assignment Progress** (Team performance)
    * **System Setup** (Integrations and Signals)
7.  **Submit:** Click **Create**.

### Onboarding Experience
Once you click **Create**, BirdDog automatically handles the rest:
* **Welcome Email:** The new user receives an email with their login credentials.
* **Support Resources:** The email includes help documentation to get them up to speed quickly.
* **Immediate Access:** They can log in and begin researching accounts right away.

### Pro-Tip: The SDR/AE Pairing
To get the most out of the **View-Only** role, pair your SDR with their specific AE. This keeps the SDR’s view clean and focused strictly on the accounts their AE is currently targeting, preventing any crossover or confusion in the outreach process.

Would you like me to create a "Permissions Matrix" that shows exactly which pages each role can access for your internal security audit?
