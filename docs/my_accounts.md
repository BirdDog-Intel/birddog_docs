### Overview
The **My Accounts** page is the command center of the BirdDog platform. While BirdDog is designed to push intelligence directly into your CRM, the homepage acts as a high-powered "workbook" where you can research accounts, identify specific buyer intent, and build targeted outreach lists.

---

### Why It Matters
The homepage allows reps to move beyond basic CRM records by providing:
1. **Dynamic Prioritization:** Instantly see which accounts have the highest "Point Scores" based on recent signals.
2. **Granular Prospecting:** Use advanced filters to find highly specific triggers (e.g., "Companies hiring their first enterprise rep") that aren't easily searchable in a standard CRM.
3. **Activity Tracking:** Distinguish between your total book of business and the accounts you are actively "Working."

### Key Workflows

#### Adding New Accounts (0:39 – 0:51)
If you have a list of targets not yet in your profile, you can upload them directly:
1. Click **Add Accounts** at the top of the page.
2. Paste a list of **Website Domains/URLs**.
3. BirdDog will start the enrichment process immediately.

> **Note:** It typically takes about **20 minutes** for the system to crawl and populate signals for newly added accounts.

#### Identifying "The Big Three" (0:52 – 1:15)
The dashboard header highlights your **top three accounts** by Point Score. These are surfaced based on:
* **Signal Strength:** The "greenest" (most positive) indicators.
* **Recency:** The most up-to-date information found in the last few days.

#### Using Filters for Outreach (1:36 – 2:22)
Instead of scrolling through hundreds of accounts, use the **Filter** tool to build a campaign. 
* **Example:** Set a filter for "Hiring a first enterprise salesperson" within the "Last 6 months."
* **Result:** BirdDog narrows your list down to the exact accounts matching that specific pain point, allowing you to write highly relevant cold emails.

### Interface Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **All Accounts vs. Working** | Toggle between your entire assigned list and accounts with recent CRM activity (emails, calls, meetings). |
| **Point Score** | A 0-100 ranking of how "hot" an account is based on BirdDog signals. |
| **CRM Status** | Real-time visibility of the account's stage in your Salesforce/HubSpot pipeline. |
| **Sort by Signal Date** | Changes the view to show the most recent triggers first (e.g., a job posting from 3 days ago). |
| **Bulk Actions** | Use the master checkbox to **Export** data or **Delete** accounts in batches. |

---

### Sorting & Searching (2:46 – 3:15)
* **Search:** Use the search bar to find specific companies (e.g., searching "Deel" to instantly see their current signals).
* **Rank vs. Date:** You can toggle your list view to prioritize either the **highest-scoring** accounts or the **most recent** updates.

### Pro-Tip: The "Zero Log-In" Goal
As noted in the walkthrough (0:23), if your CRM integration is fully optimized, you may rarely need to visit this page. However, it remains the best place to **bulk-manage account lists** and **experiment with new signal filters** before pushing those insights into your daily CRM workflow.
