### Overview
If your **Account Suggestions** is surfacing accounts that don't quite hit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), you can tune the **Account Finder** engine to be more restrictive. Refining your recommendations ensures that your team spends time only on the most exciting, high-fit opportunities.

### Two Ways to Refine Results

#### 1. Instant Feedback (0:22 – 0:38)
On the Account Suggestions page, you can "Deny" any account that doesn't fit. 
* **The Action:** Click deny and select a reason (e.g., "Not ICP").
* **The Result:** This sends direct feedback to the BirdDog team to help improve our underlying models for your specific account.

#### 2. Global Filter Adjustments (0:39 – 3:38)
For a broader fix, adjusting your Farsight settings is the most effective way to eliminate irrelevant leads.

* **Signal Calibration:** Farsight only recommends accounts that trigger at least one **"High" (Green)** signal.
    * *The Fix:* If results are too broad, reduce the number of signals marked as "High." Only tag your "top-tier" criteria as High to prevent lower-quality data from pulling in irrelevant accounts.
* **Hard Firmographic Limits:** These filters are absolute (based on LinkedIn data):
    * **Employee Count:** Set a strict range (e.g., 5–200) to stop seeing companies that are too small or too enterprise.
    * **Geography:** Restrict recommendations to specific countries, regions, or even individual U.S. states to match your sales territories.
    * **Industry Inclusion/Exclusion:** Specifically include your "bread and butter" industries or use the **Exclude** feature to block competitors or non-fit sectors.

### Managing Old vs. New Recommendations (3:39 – 4:08)
When you update your filters and click **Save and Run**, BirdDog applies those rules to all **future** searches.
* **Existing Leads:** Any accounts already on your Assignment Desk will remain there. They are not automatically deleted.
* **Full Reset:** If you want a completely fresh start based on your new filters, reach out to our support team, and we can wipe your current account suggestions to make room for the new, refined recommendations.

### Pro-Tip: The "Signal Audit"
If you have more than 5–7 signals marked as "High," you are likely casting too wide a net. Audit your Signals page and demote secondary triggers to "Low" importance to force Farsight to find only the "Slam Dunk" prospects.
