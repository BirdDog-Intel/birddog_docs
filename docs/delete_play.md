### Overview
As your sales strategy evolves, you may find that certain **Plays** are no longer applicable or that you have created duplicate filters. Keeping your Plays dashboard organized ensures your team stays focused on the most current and effective outreach strategies.

### How to Delete a Play (0:23 – 0:45)
Removing an outdated or duplicate Play is a quick process that helps declutter your workspace:

1.  **Identify the Play:** Locate the card on your main dashboard that you wish to remove.
2.  **Access Options:** Click on the **three dots (⋮)** in the top right corner of the specific Play card.
3.  **Confirm Deletion:** Select the delete option and confirm your choice.
4.  **Instant Removal:** The Play card will be immediately removed from your dashboard.

### When to Delete a Play
* **Duplicates:** If you accidentally created two versions of the same signal filter (e.g., "Expansion Opportunities").
* **Strategy Shifts:** If you are no longer targeting a specific segment (e.g., you’ve moved from Startups to Enterprise).
* **Errors:** If the logic (AND/OR) was set up incorrectly and it's faster to restart than to edit.

---

### Important Considerations
* **Account Data is Safe:** Deleting a Play **does not** delete the accounts or signals within BirdDog; it simply removes the saved filter view.
* **Irreversible:** Once a Play is deleted, you will need to manually recreate the filters, logic, and firmographic settings if you want it back.

### Pro-Tip: Clean Your Dashboard
We recommend auditing your Plays at the start of every quarter. If a Play hasn't surfaced a new account in 30 days, it’s likely too narrow or the strategy has aged—archive the thought and delete the card to make room for fresh search criteria.
