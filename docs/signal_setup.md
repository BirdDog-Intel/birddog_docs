### Overview
Signals are the specific "triggers" BirdDog looks for to identify a high-value opportunity. While BirdDog comes with a set of default signals, **Admins** have the power to create custom signals tailored to their specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). If you can ask it as a question, BirdDog can find the answer across the web.

### How to Create a New Signal (0:00 – 1:13)
1.  **Access Settings:** Log into BirdDog and navigate to the **System Setup** page (Admin only).
2.  **Configure Signals:** Click on **Configure Signals**. You will see your active list or a blank slate.
3.  **Add Signal:** Click the **Add Signal** button.
4.  **The Bracket Syntax:** When writing your question, you must use the `{account}` bracket syntax. 
    * *Example:* `Does {account} have an enterprise sales team?`
5.  **Title it:** Give your signal a clear name (e.g., "Has Enterprise Sales Team").
6.  **Add:** Click **Add**.

> **Processing Note:** Once a new signal is added, it won't show results immediately. It takes **1 to 2 hours** for the system to re-scan your existing accounts and populate the findings.

### Signal Management & Importance (1:14 – 1:53)
Once a signal is created, you can control how it impacts your dashboard and notifications:

* **Priority (High/Low):** * **High:** Signals marked as High will heavily influence the **Point Score** and cause the account to be recommended more frequently.
    * **Low:** These will be tracked but won't significantly move the needle on an account's overall score.
* **Muting:** You can toggle notifications for specific signals. This is useful if you want to track a data point for research purposes without getting an alert every time it’s found.
* **Editing:** You can refine the phrasing of your signal at any time to improve accuracy.

### Data Sources: Where BirdDog Looks (2:08 – 2:23)
BirdDog scans a massive array of public data to answer your signal questions. For a signal to be successful, the information must live within these sources:
* **Job Postings:** (The #1 source for internal strategy shifts).
* **Company Websites:** Product pages, "About Us," and blogs.
* **Financial Reports:** Earnings calls and 10-K/10-Q reports.
* **Public News:** Press releases and news articles.
* **Social Posts:** Official company updates.
