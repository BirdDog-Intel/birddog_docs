### Overview
The **Assignment Desk** is designed to learn from your preferences. While global filters handle the "hard" rules for your ICP, the **Deny** feature allows you to provide granular feedback on specific accounts. This helps "tune" the recommendation engine to better understand your specific tastes and territory needs.

### How to Deny an Account (0:22 – 1:11)
When you encounter a recommendation that doesn't fit, click the **Deny** button. You will have approximately six seconds to select a specific reason for the rejection.

#### Permanent Removal Options
Selecting any of the following will **permanently remove** the account from your recommendations. BirdDog will ensure this specific company never appears on your Assignment Desk again:
* **Wrong Size:** The company is too large or too small for your current focus.
* **Wrong Geography:** The company is headquartered outside of your selling territory.
* **Not ICP:** The company does not match your Ideal Customer Profile.

#### The "Soft" Reject: Not Exciting
* **Not Exciting:** Choosing this option tells the system that the company *fits* your profile, but the current signals aren't strong enough to warrant outreach right now.
* **The Result:** BirdDog will hide the account temporarily but will continue to re-scan it. If the account picks up more significant signals in the future, it will be brought back to the Assignment Desk for your review.

### Why Feedback Matters (1:12 – 1:32)
Providing feedback does more than just clean up your view; it "tweaks" the system:
1.  **Iterative Learning:** Every time you mark an account as "Not ICP," the system adjusts its internal logic to favor accounts with different characteristics.
2.  **Cleaner Pipeline:** It ensures your reps are only seeing accounts that are truly actionable.
3.  **Data Quality:** Consistent feedback helps the BirdDog team identify if certain signals are returning "false positives" for your industry.

### Pro-Tip: Feedback vs. Filter Adjustments
If you find yourself denying every second or third account for the same reason (e.g., they are all too small), don't just keep clicking Deny. Go to your **Recommendation Settings** and adjust the global **Employee Count** filter. This is a much faster way to fix systemic issues in your lead flow.
