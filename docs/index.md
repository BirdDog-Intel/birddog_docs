# Getting Started

BirdDog is a powerful & extensible research tool used by sales people to maximize revenue at their organization.

The BirdDog Documentations is broken into three sections:

* Quick Start Guide explains how you can build a repeatable, winning workflow in BirdDog in under an hour.
* Application Docs are an overvieew of how to get the most value out of BirdDog. Most users start here.  
* User Docs are very specific, technical instructions on how to use the platform.

    While most of the BirdDog users are sales people, the tool works great for many other things, like monitoring state legislation, watching university grant programs, & staying up to date on what your competitors or partners are up to, to name a few.
