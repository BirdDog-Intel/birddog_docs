### Overview
The **Assignment Desk** is BirdDog's strategic "air traffic control." Powered by **Farsight** (our proprietary account finder), this page surfaces high-intent, high-fit companies that you aren't currently tracking but should be. It bridges the gap between a cold lead and an active opportunity by providing a constant stream of "lookalike" recommendations based on your successful signals.

---

### The Assignment Desk (0:00 – 0:38)
The Desk is where managers and reps view and act on recommendations.
* **Identify Opportunity:** See which signals a recommended account is hitting (e.g., "Expanding Sales Team") and read a summary of the intent.
* **Assign to Reps:** Move an account from a recommendation to a monitored state by assigning it to a specific team member.
* **Scale:** The system can pull in thousands of recommendations, ensuring your team never runs out of warm prospects.

---

### Farsight Setup Modes (0:57 – 1:50)
To generate these recommendations, you must configure Farsight in the **Settings** menu. You have two primary operating modes:

1.  **My List Mode:** Upload a massive list (CSV/CRM export) and let BirdDog "clean" it—identifying only the accounts that match your high-intent signals.
2.  **Entire Internet Mode:** BirdDog crawls the web to find net-new accounts that match your ICP and exhibit your chosen signals.

---

### Configuration Requirements
Regardless of the mode, Farsight requires **at least one signal set to "High"** (Green).
* **Signal Weight:** BirdDog will only recommend accounts that trigger at least one of your High-priority signals. 
* **Pro-Tip:** Adding more High signals increases the volume and diversity of your recommendations.

---

### Mode 1: My List Setup (2:29 – 4:48)
Use this to filter a raw lead list or a stagnant CRM database.
* **Upload:** Drop in a list of URLs (recommended: 1,000+ for best results).
* **Parameters:** Set filters for employee count, headquarters location, and specific industries.
* **Auto-Add & Replace:** * Set a **Point Threshold** (e.g., 10 points) for accounts to be added automatically to your main list.
    * Use **Replace** to automatically swap out low-scoring accounts (<10 points) with new high-scoring finds.

---

### Mode 2: Entire Internet Setup (4:54 – 7:59)
This acts as your automated lead generation engine.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lookalike Modeling** | Finds accounts that "look like" your current best customers. |
| **Employee Count** | Set hard limits (e.g., 5–200) based on LinkedIn data. |
| **Geography** | Filter by region, country, or specific U.S. states. |
| **Industry Guardrails** | Include specific niches or exclude competitors/non-ICP industries. |

**Processing Note:** Farsight runs daily. After initial setup, expect to see your first batch of recommendations within **2 hours**.

---

### Pro-Tip: The "Auto-Pilot" Workflow
Enable **Auto-Add** with a **Replace** threshold. This creates a self-healing pipeline where BirdDog proactively "fires" your worst accounts and "hires" the most qualified prospects on the internet without you lifting a finger.
