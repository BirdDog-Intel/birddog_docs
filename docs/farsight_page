### Overview
**Farsight** is BirdDog’s **account recommendation engine**. It continuously improves your account list by replacing low-scoring accounts with stronger, high-potential ones.  

It can work in three main modes:  
1. **My List Mode** – improve from a specific list you upload  
2. **Entire Internet Mode** – let BirdDog discover net-new accounts that fit your ICP  
3. **Auto-Add** – automatically insert new accounts that meet thresholds  

---

### Why Farsight Matters
- Not all accounts in your CRM or lists are high quality. Many may score low (e.g., 3–5 points).  
- Farsight automatically surfaces better accounts so reps don’t waste time.  
- It can be run manually (reviewing recommendations) or automatically (auto-add).  

---

### My List Mode (1:09 – 3:45)
Use this mode when you already have a list of companies you want BirdDog to analyze.  

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Setup → Lists**.  
2. Upload a CSV of **company URLs** (from Apollo, ZoomInfo, CRM, or manual list).  
   - Supports up to **10,000 companies**.  
   - BirdDog scrapes, cleans, and scores them.  
3. Set criteria for replacement:  
   - Example: Replace accounts scoring under **10 points** with accounts above **30 points**.  
4. Save & run. Farsight will continuously review and upgrade your list.  

**Best for:**  
- Cleaning and enriching large CRM exports.  
- Improving quality of existing account lists.

### Entire Internet Mode (4:09 – 5:35)
Use this mode when you want BirdDog to **find net-new accounts** that look like your ICP.  

**Steps:**
1. Choose **Entire Internet** mode in setup.  
2. Define parameters:  
   - **Employee range** (e.g., 50–5000)  
   - **Geographies** (e.g., United States, United Kingdom)  
   - **Sectors/industries** (e.g., Technology, SaaS)  
3. Save & run. BirdDog will:  
   - Compare your current account list.  
   - Find lookalike companies in similar industries, geographies, and sizes.  
   - Recommend new accounts nightly.  

**Best for:**  
- Expanding into new territories.  
- Building a strong ICP-aligned pipeline from scratch.

### Auto-Add Recommended Accounts (2:24 – 3:17, 5:35 – 6:19)
Auto-Add lets BirdDog insert accounts into your list automatically when they meet your thresholds.  

**Setup Example:**
- Add accounts if:  
  - Score > **30 points**  
  - Match certain **signals** (e.g., hiring salespeople)  
  - Keep list below **X max accounts** (e.g., 400)  

**Workflow Options:**  
- **Auto-Add ON:** Accounts are added without manual review.  
- **Auto-Add OFF:** You review recommendations in Farsight and press:  
  - **Y** → Accept account  
  - **N** → Dismiss account  

**Best for:**  
- Teams that want fresh, high-quality accounts without constant list management.  
- Ensuring lists stay at full capacity while replacing poor performers.

### Managing & Reviewing Accounts
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**  
  - `Y` → Accept recommended account  
  - `N` → Dismiss account  
- **List Cleaning:** Automatically remove underperformers (<10 points).  
- **Nightly Refresh:** Farsight updates recommendations every night.

- **My List Mode:** Upload and clean your own accounts.  
- **Entire Internet Mode:** Discover net-new accounts that match your ICP.  
- **Auto-Add:** Automate the process to keep lists full of strong accounts.
