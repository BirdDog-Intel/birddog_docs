### Overview
If your Slack channel or inbox is becoming too noisy, you can **Mute** specific signals. Muting allows you to stop receiving real-time alerts for common or high-volume triggers while still keeping that valuable data visible on the BirdDog platform.

---

### Why Mute vs. Delete? (0:29 – 0:57)
Muting is the best option when a signal is useful for research but not urgent enough for an instant notification.

* **Keep the Data:** Muted signals still appear on the **Account Details** page and within your **Plays**.
* **Maintain Rankings:** Muted signals continue to contribute to an account's **Point Score**, ensuring your prioritization remains accurate.
* **Stop the Noise:** You will stop receiving individual Email and Slack alerts for that specific trigger.

> **Example:** You might want to track if an account has "Full-cycle Salespeople" to understand their structure, but you don't need a Slack alert every time a new job posting for that role is found.

### How to Mute a Signal (0:58 – 1:14)
1.  Navigate to **System Setup** → **Signals** → **Configure Signals**.
2.  Locate the signal in your active list.
3.  Click the **Bell Icon** next to the signal name.
4.  **Verification:** A line will appear through the bell icon, indicating that notifications are now disabled.

### Managing Notification Volume
If you find that your team is ignoring Slack alerts because there are too many, use the following hierarchy to clean up your workflow:

| Action | Result | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unmute** | Full notifications (Email + Slack). | Critical "Why Now" triggers like "New Funding" or "New Sales Leader." |
| **Mute** | Data is saved; notifications are silenced. | Generic firmographic triggers or high-volume job posting signals. |
| **Delete** | Data is wiped; monitoring stops. | Signals that are no longer relevant to your current sales strategy. |

---

### Pro-Tip: The "Research Only" Signal
Set up signals that are purely for context (e.g., "What CRM do they use?") and **Mute** them immediately. This ensures that when you open an account to do your pre-call research, the answer is there, but you weren't interrupted by a notification to find it.
