### Overview
The **Google Calendar integration** automatically connects your meetings to **BirdDog’s account research engine**, helping you get relevant insights **24 hours before your meetings**.

Once connected, BirdDog scans your upcoming calendar events and sends research briefs on the companies you’re meeting with — so you can walk into every call fully prepared.

---

### Why It Matters
- Saves time before meetings by automatically surfacing company intelligence.  
- Ensures you’re always prepared for prospects or customers on your calendar.  
- Seamlessly adds new accounts from your meetings to BirdDog (if enabled).  
- Helps reps stay informed without manually uploading lists or tracking meetings.  

---

### Setup (0:00 – 0:32)
1. Go to **Settings → Integrations** in BirdDog.  
2. Find the **Google Calendar** integration (second in the list).  
3. Click **Connect** (if not already connected).  
4. Log into your **Google Account** and grant BirdDog permission to:  
   - View your calendar events.  
   - Identify meeting participants and companies.  
5. You’ll be redirected back to BirdDog once connected successfully.  

---

### Integration Options (0:42 – 1:32)
Once connected, you’ll see three modes for how BirdDog handles new accounts from your meetings:

#### 1. **On (+ Add New Companies)**
- Automatically adds any **new companies** from meetings that aren’t already in BirdDog.  
- BirdDog will **generate research automatically** and send it 24 hours before the meeting.  
- Best for users who want a **hands-off experience** and full coverage of their calendar.  

#### 2. **On (+ Don’t Add New Companies)**
- Only sends research for meetings with **existing accounts** in BirdDog.  
- **No new companies** will be added automatically.  
- Ideal for teams who want to **control credit usage** or limit automation.  

#### 3. **Off**
- Disables meeting research notifications entirely.  
- BirdDog won’t access or act on your Google Calendar data.  

---

### Recommended Settings
Most users choose **“On (+ Add New Companies)”** to automatically get research before all meetings — especially for discovery or outbound reps.  

If you’re managing credit usage carefully, choose **“On (+ Don’t Add New Companies)”** instead.

---

### Summary
The **Google Calendar Integration** connects your calendar directly to BirdDog’s intelligence engine — helping you automatically get **account research before every meeting**.  

- **Connect once**, and BirdDog handles the rest.  
- Choose whether to **auto-add new companies** or limit to existing ones.  
- Receive **research alerts 24 hours before** each meeting.  

The result: less prep time, more context, and smarter conversations.
