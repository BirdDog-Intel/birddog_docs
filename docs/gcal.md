### Overview
The **Google Calendar integration** acts as an automated research assistant. By syncing your calendar, BirdDog can identify upcoming meetings and provide you with a comprehensive "Pre-Meeting Intelligence" brief. This ensures you walk into every call with the latest signals, news, and company background without doing any manual prep.

### Setup & Authentication (0:00 – 0:40)
Connecting your calendar takes less than a minute:
1.  Navigate to **User Settings** (bottom-left corner) and scroll to **Integrations**.
2.  Locate **Google Calendar** and click the **Connect** button.
3.  Follow the Google OAuth prompts:
    * Select your work email account.
    * Click **Continue** to grant BirdDog permission to view calendar events.
4.  Once finished, you will be redirected back to BirdDog, where your status will show as **Connected**.

### Choosing Your Sync Behavior (0:41 – 1:51)
You can customize how BirdDog handles meetings with accounts that aren't already in your system.

| Option | Behavior | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Add and Research New Accounts** | BirdDog detects a meeting with a new URL, adds it to your profile, and generates a full research brief. | High-growth reps who want automated intelligence for every new discovery call. |
| **Existing Accounts Only** | BirdDog only sends research briefs for companies already being tracked in your BirdDog "My Accounts" list. | Reps who want to strictly manage their account capacity and limit alerts to core targets. |

---

### The Pre-Meeting Research Brief
When an upcoming meeting is detected, BirdDog sends a detailed summary **24 hours in advance**. The brief includes:
* **The "Why Now" Summary:** An AI-generated narrative of recent company shifts.
* **Recent Signals:** Any hiring trends, funding rounds, or strategic pivots found in the last 180 days.
* **Company Background:** High-level details (size, industry, location) to help set the stage.
* **Source Data:** Direct links to the articles or job postings where the intelligence was found.

### Pro-Tip: Automated Capacity Management
If you select **"Add and Research New Accounts,"** BirdDog will use one of your available "tracking seats" for that account. This is the most efficient way to ensure your book of business stays aligned with your actual calendar activity. If you are at capacity, BirdDog will prioritize research for existing accounts first.
