### Overview
Archiving is a critical feature for managing your BirdDog capacity without losing historical data. When you archive an account, BirdDog **pauses monitoring** for that company. This freezes the signals and scores at their current state and, most importantly, **frees up a tracking seat** so you can add new accounts to your system.

---

### Why Archive? (0:00 – 0:21)
* **Capacity Management:** Every BirdDog plan has a limit on "active" tracked accounts. Archiving allows you to swap out cold prospects for new ones.
* **Data Retention:** Unlike deleting, archiving preserves the "Why Now" summaries and signal history you've already gathered.
* **Temporary Pause:** If a deal goes dark, archive the account to save resources, then reactivate it later to resume live monitoring.

### How to Archive Accounts

#### For Sales Reps (0:40 – 0:52)
Manage your personal book of business directly from the **My Accounts** page:
1.  **Identify Targets:** Look at the top of the page to see how many accounts you need to archive to make room for new ones.
2.  **Selection:** Check the boxes next to the accounts you wish to pause.
3.  **Action:** Click the **Archive** button.

#### For Admins & Managers (0:53 – 1:13)
Manage account capacity across the entire team from the **System Setup**:
1.  Navigate to **System Setup → Manage Accounts**.
2.  **Filter & Select:** Use filters (such as "Low Score" or "Specific Owner") to identify accounts that should be paused.
3.  **Bulk Archive:** Select the accounts and click **Archive**.

### What Happens to an Archived Account?
* **Monitoring Stops:** BirdDog will no longer crawl job boards, news, or filings for that company.
* **Scores are Frozen:** The Point Score will remain at the last recorded value.
* **Seat Freed:** One slot is immediately added back to your "Available to Add" count.
* **Reactivation:** You can search your archived list at any time and click **Activate** to resume live monitoring.

### Pro-Tip: The Capacity Indicator
Keep an eye on the message at the top of your dashboard. If it says **"You can archive X number of accounts to add more,"** it means you are nearing your tracking limit. Use this as a trigger to audit your list and archive accounts that haven't shown signal activity in the last 30 days.
