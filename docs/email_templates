### Overview
**Email Templates** in BirdDog let you combine the **context from a signal** with your own existing email language to automatically create **personalized outreach**. BirdDog blends your base email structure with real, contextual data — like hiring activity, funding rounds, or new product launches — to generate unique, relevant messages for every prospect.

### Why It Matters
- Automatically creates **personalized emails** tailored to each signal.  
- Saves time building outreach sequences or one-off campaigns.  
- Keeps messaging **consistent** across your team while still feeling individualized.  
- Works seamlessly with your connected CRMs and tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Outreach.  

### Setting Up Templates (0:32 – 3:29)
1. Go to **Settings → Email Templates**.  
2. Click **Create New Template**.  
3. Name your template (e.g., “Hiring”).  
4. Write your base email text — this should look like a typical cold or follow-up email.  

Example:  
Hi {first_name},

Saw you were hiring — how are you thinking about scaling this operation for every rep?

Thanks,
{sender_name}

5. Add **double-bracket prompts** (`<< >>`) where you want BirdDog to dynamically insert personalized AI-generated text.  

Example:  
Hi {first_name},

Saw you were hiring — <<add a note about their hiring signal and mention recent research on their team>.

Thanks,
{sender_name}

6. Click **Submit** to save your template. BirdDog will now use your prompts to automatically personalize each email based on the signal context.

### Connecting Templates to Signals (4:05 – 4:21)
Once your template is created, you can **link it to specific signals** (like “Hiring,” “Funding,” or “Product Launch”).

1. Go to the **Signals** page.  
2. Select a signal (e.g., *Hiring Multiple People*).  
3. Under the **Email Template** dropdown, choose the template you created.  
4. Click **Save**.  

Now, whenever that signal is triggered, BirdDog will use your connected template to generate a customized email automatically.

### Testing the Template (4:33 – 5:15)
1. Return to your **Accounts** page.  
2. Click **Generate** on a signal you’ve linked to your template.  
3. BirdDog will instantly generate a **personalized version** of your email.  

Example:  
> “Saw you’re hiring — I noticed your recent job postings mention expanding the research team. Thought I’d reach out since BirdDog can help you scale your outreach process efficiently.”

4. You can then:  
   - **Copy** the email to your clipboard.  
   - Send it directly from your connected **HubSpot** or **Salesforce** instance.  
   - Or refine it further with **ChatGPT** before sending.

### Pro Tips
- You can include **multiple prompts** (`[[ ]]`) in one email to personalize different sections.  
- Keep prompts **clear and action-oriented** — tell BirdDog *what you want added*, not *how to write it*.  
- Use BirdDog’s signals (like Hiring, Funding, or Expansion) to drive relevant, context-based outreach.  
- Reuse and refine templates to match your team’s tone and brand voice.  

### Summary
BirdDog **Email Templates** turn static outreach into **dynamic, personalized communication** powered by real-time signals.  
- Combine your proven email language with BirdDog’s AI personalization.  
- Connect templates directly to your signals for automated generation.  
- Deliver contextual, high-conversion messages in seconds.  

The result: faster personalization, higher reply rates, and better engagement across every sequence.
