### Overview
The **Team Page** is where admins can manage users, allocate accounts, and create organization-wide templates. It provides visibility into how accounts and credits are being distributed across the team and allows for quick scaling when new reps join.

---

### Organization Statistics (0:10 – 0:48)
At the top of the page, you’ll see key stats about your BirdDog organization:
- **Total Accounts Purchased** – All accounts your org has bought from BirdDog.  
- **Unallocated Accounts** – Accounts not yet assigned to any user (ideally always = 0).  
- **Total User Seats** – The maximum number of users who can join your organization.  
- **Active Users** – Number of team members currently in the system.  
- **Remaining Seats** – How many more users you can invite.  

---

### User Management (0:57 – 2:30)
Each user has a row showing:
- **Name/Email** – User identification.  
- **Allocated Accounts** – Accounts assigned by the admin.  
- **Active Accounts** – Accounts the user is actually working.  
- **Credits Left** – Remaining monthly credits for adding/replacing accounts.  

**Admin Controls:**  
- Adjust allocated accounts (e.g., reduce from 800 → 400 if underutilized).  
- Invite new users:
  1. Click **Invite New User**.  
  2. Enter their email and assign a starting number of accounts.  
  3. Decide whether they should inherit **organization-wide signals and templates**.  
  4. Click **Create**. BirdDog will set up the user environment.  
  5. Use the **Send Email** button to send login details, guides, and onboarding instructions.

### Organization Signals (2:54 – 3:25)
Admins can create and share **signal templates** for the whole team.  
- Create signals just like a normal user would (*Does account mention…*).  
- Assign a **title** and click **Add**.  
- Apply signals org-wide so every user benefits.  
- Adjust **priority levels** to influence rankings and Farsight recommendations.  
- Link signals to **email templates** for faster outreach.

---

### Email Templates (3:25 – 3:40)
- Build **email templates** inside the Team Page for consistent messaging.  
- Each template includes:  
  - A title  
  - Example email body  
  - Template fields for personalization  
- Apply templates to signals for automated suggestions.  
- Tutorials are available inside the platform for deeper guidance.
