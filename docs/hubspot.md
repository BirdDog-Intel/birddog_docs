1. Choose your **HubSpot account** (if you have multiple).  
2. Click **Choose Account** to continue.

### Field Mapping (0:42 – 1:20)
On the **mapping page**, you can specify how BirdDog’s fields should correspond to HubSpot properties.

**Account Field Mapping Example:**
- `Domain` → required field for company matching.  
- `HubSpot Account ID` or `HS Object ID` → ensures proper syncing with existing records.  

You can map any other BirdDog fields to HubSpot properties as needed.

When finished, click **Submit** to save your mappings.

### Optional: Deal Field Mapping (1:20 – 1:30)
If you’d like BirdDog to sync deal-related insights, you can also map your **deal fields** on this same page.

1. Select the relevant deal fields from the dropdown.  
2. Click **Submit** to save your configuration.  

This allows BirdDog to push deal enrichment data into your CRM automatically.
