### Overview
As your sales strategy evolves, you may find that certain triggers are no longer relevant to your outreach. Deleting a signal ensures your dashboard stays clean and that you stop receiving notifications for data points that aren't driving value for your team.

### How to Delete a Signal (0:00 – 0:22)
The process is straightforward and managed through the central signal configuration area:

1.  Navigate to **System Setup** from the bottom-left sidebar.
2.  Go to **Signals** → **Configure Signals**.
3.  Locate the signal you wish to remove from your active list.
4.  Click the **Trashcan** icon next to the signal name.
5.  Confirm the action by clicking **Yes** in the pop-up window.

### What Happens After Deletion? (0:23 – 0:32)
Deleting a signal triggers an automated cleanup across your entire platform:

* **Removal from Accounts:** Over the following hour, the system will strip that specific signal data from all accounts in your organization.
* **Notification Stop:** You will immediately stop receiving alerts (Email, Slack, or In-App) for that specific trigger.
* **Point Score Recalculation:** Deleting a signal may result in a slight shift in your account scores, as that criteria is no longer being factored into the intent ranking.

### Pro-Tip: Delete vs. Mute
If you think you might need the signal again in the future, consider **muting** the notifications or setting the importance to **Low** instead of deleting it. Deletion is permanent; if you change your mind later, you will need to recreate the signal question and wait for the system to re-scan all your accounts.
