BirdDog monitors public signals (news, job postings, company sites, filings, earnings calls/reports, social) for your target accounts. You define Signals (questions you want BirdDog to answer about accounts), and BirdDog surfaces matches with source links, summaries, and next-step actions. Farsight improves your account list over time by replacing weak accounts with stronger ones.</p> <p>How does BirdDog find buying signals? It continuously crawls and analyzes public data, matching it to your Signals. When a match is found (e.g., \u201chiring multiple AEs\u201d or \u201cnew CRO\u201d), BirdDog summarizes why it matters and links to the original source.</p> <p>What data sources does BirdDog use? Press releases, news sites, company websites, job boards/postings, SEC/financial filings, earnings calls/reports, and certain social/professional sources. You can see source links on each signal.</p> <p>How often is account and signal data refreshed? BirdDog refreshes daily; Farsight recommendations and account rescoring also update nightly.</p> <p>Can I integrate BirdDog with my CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)? Yes. From an account, you can jump directly to CRM records (HubSpot/Salesforce). To set this up, email hello@getbirddog.ai or reach out to the team in your Slack channel.</p> <p>What keyboard shortcuts should I know to work faster? - Enter: Open Next Steps / advance the current signal - I: Open account\u2019s LinkedIn page - D: Dismiss a signal in Signals view - Y / N: Accept / Dismiss Farsight recommendations</p>"},{"location":"frequently_asked_questions/#accounts-credits","title":"Accounts &amp; Credits","text":"<p>What are BirdDog credits? Credits are monthly allowances to add/replace accounts being actively monitored. Each active account consumes capacity; credits let you swap in new ones.</p> <p>How do credits reset each month? They reset automatically at the start of your billing cycle. You\u2019ll see your credits available and accounts you can add now in Account Manager.</p> <p>What happens if I hit my account limit? You won\u2019t be able to add new accounts until you archive some existing ones (freeing capacity, when available) or your credits reset.</p> <p>How do I archive accounts to free up space? In Account Manager, select accounts \u2192 Archive. Archived accounts stop daily monitoring and free up capacity for new adds.</p> <p>What\u2019s the difference between deleting and archiving accounts? - Archive: Keeps history but pauses monitoring (recommended). - Delete: Removes the account permanently from your tenant (use cautiously).</p> <p>How do I upload new accounts into BirdDog? In Account Manager \u2192 paste one or more company URLs (or a CSV list) into the input \u2192 choose the target list \u2192 Add.</p> <p>Can I upload accounts from tools like Apollo or ZoomInfo? Yes. Export domains/URLs from those tools and paste/upload into BirdDog (Account Manager or Farsight My List Mode).</p> <p>Why do some accounts show a score of 0? They\u2019re newly added or still scraping. Scores typically appear within ~20-60 minutes as BirdDog ingests and analyzes sources.</p>"},{"location":"frequently_asked_questions/#lists","title":"Lists","text":"<p>What are lists in BirdDog?
