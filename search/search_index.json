BirdDog monitors public signals (news, job postings, company sites, filings, earnings calls/reports, social) for your target accounts. You define Signals (questions you want BirdDog to answer about accounts), and BirdDog surfaces matches with source links, summaries, and next-step actions. Farsight improves your account list over time by replacing weak accounts with stronger ones.</p> <p>How does BirdDog find buying signals? It continuously crawls and analyzes public data, matching it to your Signals. When a match is found (e.g., \u201chiring multiple AEs\u201d or \u201cnew CRO\u201d), BirdDog summarizes why it matters and links to the original source.</p> <p>What data sources does BirdDog use? Press releases, news sites, company websites, job boards/postings, SEC/financial filings, earnings calls/reports, and certain social/professional sources. You can see source links on each signal.</p> <p>How often is account and signal data refreshed? BirdDog refreshes daily; Farsight recommendations and account rescoring also update nightly.</p> <p>Can I integrate BirdDog with my CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)? Yes. From an account, you can jump directly to CRM records (HubSpot/Salesforce).
