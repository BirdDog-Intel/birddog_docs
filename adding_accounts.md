### Overview
Adding accounts is the first step toward generating high-intent signals. BirdDog is designed to be flexible—you can add a single target or a bulk list of hundreds of companies in seconds. Once added, BirdDog’s engine begins crawling for specific triggers and calculating the intent scores for your new prospects.

### How to Add Accounts (0:00 – 0:35)
1.  Navigate to the **My Accounts** page.
2.  Click the **Add Accounts** button in the top right.
3.  **Input your list:** Paste company URLs directly into the field. 
    * **No Formatting Needed:** You can copy-paste directly from Excel, Google Sheets, or a raw text file. Commas or special separators are not required.
4.  **Select Target List (Admins only):** If you are an admin, choose which team member or specific list these accounts should be assigned to.
5.  **Submit:** Click **Add Accounts** to trigger the research process.

> **Processing Time:** Accounts typically take between **20 minutes and 1 hour** to fully populate with data and signals. You will know an account is finished once a **Point Score** appears next to it.

### Managing Capacity (0:44 – 1:04)
Every BirdDog license has a specific capacity for tracked accounts. The status bar at the top of the "Add Accounts" window provides a real-time view of your limits:

* **Tracking Limit:** The total number of accounts your plan allows you to monitor simultaneously.
* **Available to Add:** The number of slots you have left before reaching your cap.
* **Archive/Delete Recommendation:** If you are at capacity, the system will show you how many accounts you need to **Archive** or **Delete** to make room for new targets.

### Pro-Tip: Swapping Accounts
BirdDog allows you to "swap" your list. If an account is no longer a priority, you can archive it to immediately free up a seat for a new high-potential URL. This allows you to keep your pipeline fresh without necessarily increasing your total seat count.
