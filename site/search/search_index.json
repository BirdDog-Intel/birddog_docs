So, the highest ranking account will be the first one you see. </p> <p>Throughout the platform, you will often see the score reported as a Percentile next to an account. This tells you what percent of other accounts on that list that an account is better than.

This is because our people data comes from info that is publicly available on company websites or in news articles or is made publicly available by LinkedIn for search engines to index. We respect LinkedIn\u2019s Terms of Service.</p> <p>Note: It is easy to find contact data for a contact that BirdDog surfaces by clicking the get email button that will take you to Apollo. With a free account, you can leverage their platform to get contact data.
